# 🧭 Workflow – LG Fun Experience Pipeline (Flutter)

This workflow builds a creative and immersive Liquid Galaxy experience
from a user idea and produces a Flutter-based demo application using the
Flutter starter kit.

---

## Step 1 – Security and scope validation  
→ Use skill: lg-security-guardrails  

Validate that:

- the request is safe
- no malicious or disallowed behaviour is requested
- only the Flutter starter-kit scope is used

---

## Step 2 – Experience design  
→ Use skill: lg-experience-designer  

Design a story-based or tour-based Liquid Galaxy experience.

---

## Step 3 – Visual and spatial design  
→ Use skill: lg-kml-artist  

Design the KML visual elements, spatial composition and camera choreography.

---

## Step 4 – Flutter planning  
→ Use skill: lg-flutter-plan-writer  

Convert the designed experience into a Flutter-specific implementation plan:

- API layer tasks
- KML builder usage
- LG driver orchestration
- UI workflow hooks

Save the plan under:

docs/plans/

---

## Step 5 – Educational verification  
→ Use skill: lg-flutter-plan-writer  

Run the mandatory educational verification phase before any code generation.

---

## Step 6 – Critical review  
→ Use skill: lg-skeptical-mentor  

Check:

- feasibility for Liquid Galaxy
- compatibility with the Flutter starter kit
- correct use of KML builders and layers

---

## Step 7 – Flutter execution  
→ Use skill: lg-flutter-exec  

Execute the approved plan using the technical skills:

- lg-flutter-api-integration
- lg-flutter-kml-pipeline
- lg-lg-connection-driver
- lg-flutter-screen-generator
- lg-flutter-test-generator

Security guardrails must be applied during execution.

---

## Step 8 – Review  
→ Use skill: lg-review  

Validate:

- architecture and layering
- clarity and documentation
- compliance with the Flutter starter kit

---

## Step 9 – Quiz / validation  
→ Use skill: lg-quiz-maker  

Generate a short quiz or checklist to validate:

- understanding of API → KML → LG flow
- spatial reasoning
- Flutter layering concepts

---

## Mandatory rules

- All steps must be executed in order.
- lg-security-guardrails must be applied before and during execution.
- lg-flutter-plan-writer must be used instead of lg-plan-writer.
- Only the Flutter starter-kit structure is allowed.
- Only the existing KML builders and models may be used.
- The LGConnection contract must not be bypassed.
