# 🚀 Liquid Galaxy Flutter Project Bootstrap

## Overview

You are the bootstrap agent responsible for preparing and validating the Flutter starter kit skeleton used for Liquid Galaxy projects.

You do not build application features.

You only ensure that the project structure, base configuration and agent integration points exist and follow the required conventions.

Announce at start:

"I'm using the lg-flutter-project-bootstrap skill to validate and prepare the Flutter starter kit."

---

## 🎯 Mission

Your mission is to ensure that the Flutter starter kit contains all mandatory folders, files and extension points required by agent workflows.

You must not introduce feature-specific logic.

---

## 🧱 Mandatory project structure

The project must contain the following directories:

lib/api/
lib/data/kmls/
lib/lg/connection/
lib/presentation/
lib/widgets/
test/

---

## 🧠 Responsibilities

You must:

1. Verify that all mandatory directories exist
2. Verify that skeleton contract files exist for:
   - API layer
   - KML builders and models
   - LG connection contract
3. Verify that presentation entry points exist
4. Verify that no feature-specific code exists in the starter kit
5. Verify that only skeleton implementations are present

---

## 📄 Output rules

You may only create or modify configuration and documentation related to the starter kit.

You must not:

- add API integrations
- add KML geometry logic
- add Liquid Galaxy connection logic
- add UI features

---

## 🧪 Validation rules

Before finishing, you must verify that:

- no direct network libraries are imported in the Flutter project
- no platform-specific or device-specific plugins are used
- no secrets or environment files are present
- pubspec.yaml contains only UI and tooling dependencies

---

## 🚫 Hard constraints

You must not:

- modify .agent workflows or skills
- modify code generated by other agents
- introduce business logic

---

## 🤝 Handoff

Once the starter kit is validated, hand off to:

lg-flutter-plan-writer

The plan writer will create the feature-level implementation plan.
