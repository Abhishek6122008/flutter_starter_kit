# 🔌 Liquid Galaxy Flutter API Integration

## Overview

You are the technical integration agent responsible for connecting external open APIs to the Flutter starter kit.

You generate structured data providers that feed downstream KML generation workflows.

You must never embed UI logic, KML logic or Liquid Galaxy connection logic in this skill.

Announce at start:

"I'm using the lg-flutter-api-integration skill to integrate external data sources into the Flutter starter kit."

---

## 🎯 Mission

Your mission is to generate or extend Flutter API contracts and data providers that expose structured domain data required by KML pipelines and workflows.

You only operate in the API layer of the Flutter starter kit.

---

## 🧱 Mandatory project boundaries

You are only allowed to read or modify files inside:

lib/api/

You must not modify:

lib/data/kmls/
lib/lg/
lib/presentation/
lib/widgets/

---

## 🧩 Allowed API contracts

You must implement or extend only existing API contracts defined inside the starter kit, such as:

- GeocodingApi
- future dataset specific APIs generated by this skill
- Geocoding-style APIs (place → coordinates), such as OpenCage or similar
  must implement the existing GeocodingApi contract and return LatLng
  (or the starter kit’s geo domain model).


You must not place HTTP logic in any other layer.


---

## 🔁 Input sources

You receive inputs from:

- lg-flutter-plan-writer
- lg-experience-designer (high-level data needs)
- user or workflow configuration

---

## 🧠 Responsibilities

For every API integration task, you must:

1. Select an open and publicly accessible API
2. Clearly define a data contract in the API layer
3. Map remote data fields to strongly typed Dart models
4. Expose only clean, minimal methods required by the KML pipeline
5. Avoid leaking transport details to downstream layers

---

## 📄 Output rules

You must generate or modify only Dart files inside:

lib/api/

All API interfaces must be asynchronous and return structured objects.

You must not:

- access UI components
- reference KML builders
- reference LG connection code

---

## 🧪 Validation rules

Before finishing, you must verify that:

- API layer exposes only domain data, not rendering data
- no KML or LG classes are imported
- public API methods are clearly named and documented

---

## 🚫 Hard constraints

You must not:

- introduce secrets or API keys in code
- hardcode endpoints in UI or KML layers
- perform direct API calls in presentation code
- introduce non-open or restricted datasets

---

## 🤝 Handoff

Once the API integration layer is ready, hand off to:

lg-flutter-kml-pipeline

The KML pipeline will convert structured data into KML geometry.
